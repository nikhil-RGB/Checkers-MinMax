## AI Opponent(beta)

- A basic AI opponent has been implemented using the Minimax with alpha beta pruning.
- The tree goes 4 levels deep before running the evaluation function.
- The evaluation function performs a standard material evaluation with a 3x multiplier for king pieces. Positional advantage        scores might be added to the function in the future.   
- The option to switch between AI and a normal human player will be added soon.
- When the AI performs consecutive captures, it will not be shown step by step. This will be changed in the future in favour of a   better UX.
